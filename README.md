## Machine Learning Projects
### Project 1: Loan Interest Rate Prediction
This project aims to analyze the various borrower information in the loan market and build machine learning models to predict the interest rate assigned to the loan. 

**Models Performance Table:**
| Ridge Regression CV RMSE | KNN CV RMSE | GradientBoosting CV RMSE(Winning)|
|----------|----------|----------|
| 0.0351 | 0.0344 | 0.0318(**Final RMSE on Test Set: 0.0280** ) |
